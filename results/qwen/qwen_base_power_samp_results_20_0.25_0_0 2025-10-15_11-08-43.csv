Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$,70,"Can you solve the following math problem? Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all integer bases \( b > 9 \) for which \( 17_b \) is a divisor of \( 97_b \). Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the numbers from base \( b \) to base 10:**
   - \( 17_b \) in base 10 is \( 1 \cdot b + 7 = b + 7 \).
   - \( 97_b \) in base 10 is \( 9 \cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7 \).

2. **Determine the condition for divisibility:**
   - We need \( 9b + 7 \) to be divisible by \( b + 7 \). This means \( 9b + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 7} \).

3. **Simplify the congruence:**
   - Rewrite \( 9b + 7 \) in terms of \( b + 7 \):
     \[
     9b + 7 = 9(b + 7) - 56
     \]
   - Since \( 9(b + 7) \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 7} \), we have:
     \[
     9b + 7 \equiv -56 \pmod{b + 7}
     \]
   - For \( 9b + 7 \) to be divisible by \( b + 7 \), \(-56\) must be divisible by \( b + 7 \). Therefore, \( b + 7 \) must be a divisor of 56.

4. **Find the divisors of 56:**
   - The divisors of 56 are: \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 7, \pm 8, \pm 14, \pm 28, \pm 56 \).

5. **Determine the valid bases \( b \):**
   - Since \( b > 9 \), we only consider positive divisors greater than 9:
     \[
     b + 7 = 14 \implies b = 7 \quad (\text{not valid since } b > 9)
     \]
     \[
     b + 7 = 28 \implies b = 21
     \]
     \[
     b + 7 = 56 \implies b = 49
     \]

6. **Sum the valid bases:**
   - The valid bases are \( b = 21 \) and \( b = 49 \).
   - The sum of these bases is:
     \[
     21 + 49 = 70
     \]

Therefore, the sum of all integer bases \( b > 9 \) for which \( 17_b \) is a divisor of \( 97_b \) is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,28095,156.85333037376404,0.46

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the heptagon \(AFNBCEM\) given the areas and lengths provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(AD = 4\), \(DE = 16\), \(EB = 8\)
   - \(AF = 13\), \(FG = 52\), \(GC = 26\)
   - The area of quadrilateral \(DEGF\) is 288.

2. **Determine the coordinates of the points:**
   - Let \(A\) be at \((0, 100)\).
   - \(D\) is 4 units from \(A\) on \(AB\), so \(D\) is at \((4, 100)\).
   - \(E\) is 16 units from \(D\) on \(AB\), so \(E\) is at \((20, 100)\).
   - \(B\) is 8 units from \(E\) on \(AB\), so \(B\) is at \((28, 100)\).
   - \(F\) is 13 units from \(A\) on \(AC\), so \(F\) is at \((13, 50)\).
   - \(G\) is 52 units from \(F\) on \(AC\), so \(G\) is at \((65, 50)\).
   - \(C\) is 26 units from \(G\) on \(AC\), so \(C\) is at \((91, 50)\).

3. **Find the coordinates of \(M\) and \(N\):**
   - \(M\) is the reflection of \(D\) through \(F\). The midpoint of \(DF\) is \((\frac{4+13}{2}, \frac{100+50}{2}) = (8.5, 75)\). The slope of \(DF\) is \(\frac{50-100}{13-4} = -\frac{50}{9}\). The slope of the perpendicular bisector is \(\frac{9}{50}\). The equation of the perpendicular bisector is \(y - 75 = \frac{9}{50}(x - 8.5)\). Solving for \(M\), we get \(M = (165, 80)\).
   - \(N\) is the reflection of \(G\) through \(E\). The midpoint of \(GE\) is \((\frac{65+20}{2}, \frac{50+100}{2}) = (42.5, 75)\). The slope of \(GE\) is \(\frac{50-100}{20-65} = \frac{50}{45} = \frac{10}{9}\). The slope of the perpendicular bisector is \(-\frac{9}{10}\). The equation of the perpendicular bisector is \(y - 75 = -\frac{9}{10}(x - 42.5)\). Solving for \(N\), we get \(N = (0, 50)\).

4. **Calculate the area of the heptagon \(AFNBCEM\):**
   - The area of \(AFNBCEM\) is the area of \(\triangle ABC\) minus the area of quadrilateral \(DEGF\).
   - The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \times 50 = 700\).
   - The area of quadrilateral \(DEGF\) is given as 288.
   - Therefore, the area of the heptagon \(AFNBCEM\) is \(700 - 288 = 412\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{412}\).",412,92864,284.9610071182251,0.35714285714285715

The 9 members of a baseball team went to an ice-cream parlor after their game. Each player had a singlescoop cone of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream.

Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign ice cream flavors to the 9 players such that each flavor is chosen by at least one player, and the number of players choosing chocolate is greater than the number of players choosing vanilla, which is greater than the number of players choosing strawberry. Let's denote the number of players choosing chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry by \(c\), \(v\), and \(s\) respectively. We need to find the number of solutions to the equation \(c + v + s = 9\) under the constraints \(c > v > s \geq 1\).

First, we make a substitution to simplify the constraints. Let \(c = x + 3\), \(v = y + 2\), and \(s = z + 1\) where \(x, y, z \geq 0\). This substitution ensures that \(c > v > s\). The equation \(c + v + s = 9\) becomes:
\[
(x + 3) + (y + 2) + (z + 1) = 9 \implies x + y + z = 3.
\]
Now, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to \(x + y + z = 3\). This is a classic ""stars and bars"" problem, and the number of solutions is given by:
\[
\binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]
For each solution \((x, y, z)\), we need to assign the players to the flavors. The number of ways to assign 9 players to 3 flavors such that there are \(c\) players choosing chocolate, \(v\) players choosing vanilla, and \(s\) players choosing strawberry is given by the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\frac{9!}{c!v!s!} = \frac{9!}{(x+3)!(y+2)!(z+1)!}.
\]
We now calculate this for each solution \((x, y, z)\):

1. For \((x, y, z) = (3, 0, 0)\), we have \(c = 6\), \(v = 2\), \(s = 1\):
\[
\frac{9!}{6!2!1!} = \frac{362880}{720 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 252.
\]
2. For \((x, y, z) = (2, 1, 0)\), we have \(c = 5\), \(v = 3\), \(s = 1\):
\[
\frac{9!}{5!3!1!} = \frac{362880}{120 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = 420.
\]
3. For \((x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1)\), we have \(c = 4\), \(v = 3\), \(s = 2\):
\[
\frac{9!}{4!3!2!} = \frac{362880}{24 \cdot 6 \cdot 2} = 1260.
\]
Adding these together, we get the total number of assignments:
\[
252 + 420 + 1260 = 1932.
\]
Finally, we need to find the remainder when 1932 is divided by 1000:
\[
1932 \mod 1000 = 932.
\]
Thus, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{932}\).",932,34759,195.89445209503174,0.38
