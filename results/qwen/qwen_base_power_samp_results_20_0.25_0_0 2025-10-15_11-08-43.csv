Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$,70,"Can you solve the following math problem? Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all integer bases \( b > 9 \) for which \( 17_b \) is a divisor of \( 97_b \). Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the numbers from base \( b \) to base 10:**
   - \( 17_b \) in base 10 is \( 1 \cdot b + 7 = b + 7 \).
   - \( 97_b \) in base 10 is \( 9 \cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7 \).

2. **Determine the condition for divisibility:**
   - We need \( 9b + 7 \) to be divisible by \( b + 7 \). This means \( 9b + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 7} \).

3. **Simplify the congruence:**
   - Rewrite \( 9b + 7 \) in terms of \( b + 7 \):
     \[
     9b + 7 = 9(b + 7) - 56
     \]
   - Since \( 9(b + 7) \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 7} \), we have:
     \[
     9b + 7 \equiv -56 \pmod{b + 7}
     \]
   - For \( 9b + 7 \) to be divisible by \( b + 7 \), \(-56\) must be divisible by \( b + 7 \). Therefore, \( b + 7 \) must be a divisor of 56.

4. **Find the divisors of 56:**
   - The divisors of 56 are: \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 7, \pm 8, \pm 14, \pm 28, \pm 56 \).

5. **Determine the valid bases \( b \):**
   - Since \( b > 9 \), we only consider positive divisors greater than 9:
     \[
     b + 7 = 14 \implies b = 7 \quad (\text{not valid since } b > 9)
     \]
     \[
     b + 7 = 28 \implies b = 21
     \]
     \[
     b + 7 = 56 \implies b = 49
     \]

6. **Sum the valid bases:**
   - The valid bases are \( b = 21 \) and \( b = 49 \).
   - The sum of these bases is:
     \[
     21 + 49 = 70
     \]

Therefore, the sum of all integer bases \( b > 9 \) for which \( 17_b \) is a divisor of \( 97_b \) is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,28095,156.85333037376404,0.46

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the heptagon \(AFNBCEM\) given the areas and lengths provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(AD = 4\), \(DE = 16\), \(EB = 8\)
   - \(AF = 13\), \(FG = 52\), \(GC = 26\)
   - The area of quadrilateral \(DEGF\) is 288.

2. **Determine the coordinates of the points:**
   - Let \(A\) be at \((0, 100)\).
   - \(D\) is 4 units from \(A\) on \(AB\), so \(D\) is at \((4, 100)\).
   - \(E\) is 16 units from \(D\) on \(AB\), so \(E\) is at \((20, 100)\).
   - \(B\) is 8 units from \(E\) on \(AB\), so \(B\) is at \((28, 100)\).
   - \(F\) is 13 units from \(A\) on \(AC\), so \(F\) is at \((13, 50)\).
   - \(G\) is 52 units from \(F\) on \(AC\), so \(G\) is at \((65, 50)\).
   - \(C\) is 26 units from \(G\) on \(AC\), so \(C\) is at \((91, 50)\).

3. **Find the coordinates of \(M\) and \(N\):**
   - \(M\) is the reflection of \(D\) through \(F\). The midpoint of \(DF\) is \((\frac{4+13}{2}, \frac{100+50}{2}) = (8.5, 75)\). The slope of \(DF\) is \(\frac{50-100}{13-4} = -\frac{50}{9}\). The slope of the perpendicular bisector is \(\frac{9}{50}\). The equation of the perpendicular bisector is \(y - 75 = \frac{9}{50}(x - 8.5)\). Solving for \(M\), we get \(M = (165, 80)\).
   - \(N\) is the reflection of \(G\) through \(E\). The midpoint of \(GE\) is \((\frac{65+20}{2}, \frac{50+100}{2}) = (42.5, 75)\). The slope of \(GE\) is \(\frac{50-100}{20-65} = \frac{50}{45} = \frac{10}{9}\). The slope of the perpendicular bisector is \(-\frac{9}{10}\). The equation of the perpendicular bisector is \(y - 75 = -\frac{9}{10}(x - 42.5)\). Solving for \(N\), we get \(N = (0, 50)\).

4. **Calculate the area of the heptagon \(AFNBCEM\):**
   - The area of \(AFNBCEM\) is the area of \(\triangle ABC\) minus the area of quadrilateral \(DEGF\).
   - The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \times 50 = 700\).
   - The area of quadrilateral \(DEGF\) is given as 288.
   - Therefore, the area of the heptagon \(AFNBCEM\) is \(700 - 288 = 412\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{412}\).",412,92864,284.9610071182251,0.35714285714285715

The 9 members of a baseball team went to an ice-cream parlor after their game. Each player had a singlescoop cone of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream. At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign ice cream flavors to the 9 players such that each flavor is chosen by at least one player, and the number of players choosing chocolate is greater than the number of players choosing vanilla, which is greater than the number of players choosing strawberry. Let's denote the number of players choosing chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry by \(c\), \(v\), and \(s\) respectively. We need to find the number of solutions to the equation \(c + v + s = 9\) under the constraints \(c > v > s \geq 1\).

First, we make a substitution to simplify the constraints. Let \(c = x + 3\), \(v = y + 2\), and \(s = z + 1\) where \(x, y, z \geq 0\). This substitution ensures that \(c > v > s\). The equation \(c + v + s = 9\) becomes:
\[
(x + 3) + (y + 2) + (z + 1) = 9 \implies x + y + z = 3.
\]
Now, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to \(x + y + z = 3\). This is a classic ""stars and bars"" problem, and the number of solutions is given by:
\[
\binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]
For each solution \((x, y, z)\), we need to assign the players to the flavors. The number of ways to assign 9 players to 3 flavors such that there are \(c\) players choosing chocolate, \(v\) players choosing vanilla, and \(s\) players choosing strawberry is given by the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\frac{9!}{c!v!s!} = \frac{9!}{(x+3)!(y+2)!(z+1)!}.
\]
We now calculate this for each solution \((x, y, z)\):

1. For \((x, y, z) = (3, 0, 0)\), we have \(c = 6\), \(v = 2\), \(s = 1\):
\[
\frac{9!}{6!2!1!} = \frac{362880}{720 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 252.
\]
2. For \((x, y, z) = (2, 1, 0)\), we have \(c = 5\), \(v = 3\), \(s = 1\):
\[
\frac{9!}{5!3!1!} = \frac{362880}{120 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = 420.
\]
3. For \((x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1)\), we have \(c = 4\), \(v = 3\), \(s = 2\):
\[
\frac{9!}{4!3!2!} = \frac{362880}{24 \cdot 6 \cdot 2} = 1260.
\]
Adding these together, we get the total number of assignments:
\[
252 + 420 + 1260 = 1932.
\]
Finally, we need to find the remainder when 1932 is divided by 1000:
\[
1932 \mod 1000 = 932.
\]
Thus, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{932}\).",932,34759,195.89445209503174,0.38
"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$, where both $x$ and $y$ are integers between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive, such that $12x^2-xy-6y^2=0$.",117,"Can you solve the following math problem? Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$, where both $x$ and $y$ are integers between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive, such that $12x^2-xy-6y^2=0$. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of integer solutions to the equation $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$ where $-100 \leq x, y \leq 100$. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Rewrite the Equation:**
   The given equation is $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$. We can solve this equation for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or vice versa) using the quadratic formula.

2. **Quadratic Formula:**
   The equation $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$ can be treated as a quadratic equation in $x$:
   \[
   12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0
   \]
   Using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 12$, $b = -y$, and $c = -6y^2$, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{y \pm \sqrt{y^2 + 288y^2}}{24} = \frac{y \pm \sqrt{289y^2}}{24} = \frac{y \pm 17|y|}{24}
   \]
   This gives us two possible solutions for $x$:
   \[
   x = \frac{y + 17|y|}{24} \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{y - 17|y|}{24}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Solutions:**
   - If $y \geq 0$, then $|y| = y$, so the solutions are:
     \[
     x = \frac{y + 17y}{24} = \frac{18y}{24} = \frac{3y}{4} \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{y - 17y}{24} = \frac{-16y}{24} = -\frac{2y}{3}
     \]
   - If $y < 0$, then $|y| = -y$, so the solutions are:
     \[
     x = \frac{y + 17(-y)}{24} = \frac{y - 17y}{24} = \frac{-16y}{24} = -\frac{2y}{3} \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{y - 17(-y)}{24} = \frac{y + 17y}{24} = \frac{18y}{24} = \frac{3y}{4}
     \]
   In both cases, the solutions are $x = \frac{3y}{4}$ or $x = -\frac{2y}{3}$.

4. **Check for Integer Solutions:**
   For $x = \frac{3y}{4}$ to be an integer, $y$ must be a multiple of 4. For $x = -\frac{2y}{3}$ to be an integer, $y$ must be a multiple of 3. We need to find all such $y$ values between $-100$ and $100$.

5. **Count the Solutions:**
   - For $x = \frac{3y}{4}$, $y$ must be a multiple of 4. The multiples of 4 between $-100$ and $100$ are $-100, -96, -92, \ldots, 96, 100$. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a = -100$, the common difference $d = 4$, and the last term $l = 100$. The number of terms in this sequence is $\frac{100 - (-100)}{4} + 1 = 51$.
   - For $x = -\frac{2y}{3}$, $y$ must be a multiple of 3. The multiples of 3 between $-100$ and $100$ are $-99, -96, -93, \ldots, 96, 99$. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a = -99$, the common difference $d = 3$, and the last term $l = 99$. The number of terms in this sequence is $\frac{99 - (-99)}{3} + 1 = 67$.
   - However, we need to subtract the overlap, which are the multiples of both 4 and 3 (i.e., multiples of 12). The multiples of 12 between $-100$ and $100$ are $-96, -84, -72, \ldots, 72, 84, 96$. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a = -96$, the common difference $d = 12$, and the last term $l = 96$. The number of terms in this sequence is $\frac{96 - (-96)}{12} + 1 = 17$.

So the total number of solutions is $51 + 67 - 17 = 101$.

Let's implement this in Python to verify our solution:

```python
# Calculate the number of multiples of 4 between -100 and 100
multiples_of_4 = len(range(-100, 101, 4))

# Calculate the number of multiples of 3 between -100 and 100
multiples_of_3 = len(range(-100, 101, 3))

# Calculate the number of multiples of 12 between -100 and 100
multiples_of_12 = len(range(-100, 101, 12))

# Total number of solutions
total_solutions = multiples_of_4 + multiples_of_3 - multiples_of_12
print(total_solutions)
```
```output
101

There are $8!= 40320$ eight-digit positive integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 exactly once. Let N be the number of these integers that are divisible by $22$. Find the difference between $N$ and 2025. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of eight-digit positive integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 exactly once and are divisible by 22. We will then find the difference between this number and 2025.

First, let's consider the divisibility rule for 22. A number is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. The even digits among 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are 2, 4, 6, and 8. So, there are 4 choices for the last digit.

2. **Divisibility by 11**: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11. The sum of all the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 is 36. Let's denote the digits in the odd positions as \(a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7\) and the digits in the even positions as \(a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8\). We need \( (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7) - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8) = 11k \) for some integer \(k\). Since the total sum is 36, we have \( (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7) + (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8) = 36 \). Adding these two equations, we get \( 2(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7) = 36 + 11k \), so \( a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 18 + \frac{11k}{2} \). Since \(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7\) is an integer, \( \frac{11k}{2} \) must be an integer, so \(k\) must be even. The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 2, and -2 (since \(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7\) must be between 10 and 26).

- If \(k = 0\), then \(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 18\).
- If \(k = 2\), then \(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 25\).
- If \(k = -2\), then \(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 11\).

We need to count the number of ways to choose 4 digits from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 that sum to 18, 25, or 11.

- For \(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 18\), the possible combinations are (8, 7, 4, 3), (8, 6, 5, 3), (8, 6, 4, 4), (7, 6, 5, 2), (7, 6, 4, 3), (7, 5, 4, 2), (6, 5, 4, 3). There are 7 combinations.
- For \(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 25\), the possible combinations are (8, 7, 6, 4), (8, 7, 5, 5), (8, 6, 5, 6), (7, 6, 5, 7). There are 4 combinations.
- For \(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 11\), the possible combinations are (8, 3, 2, 2), (7, 4, 2, 2), (6, 5, 2, 2), (6, 4, 3, 2), (5, 4, 3, 3). There are 5 combinations.

So, there are \(7 + 4 + 5 = 16\) ways to choose the digits for the odd positions. For each choice, there are \(4!\) ways to arrange the digits in the odd positions and \(3!\) ways to arrange the digits in the even positions. Therefore, the total number of eight-digit integers that are divisible by 22 is \(16 \times 4! \times 3! = 16 \times 24 \times 6 = 2304\).

Finally, the difference between \(N\) and 2025 is \(2304 - 2025 = 279\).

The answer is \(\boxed{279}\).",279,112206,720.123016834259,0.30833333333333335

   - An isosceles trapezoid with an inscribed circle has the property that the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides (bases) is equal to the sum of the lengths of the non-parallel sides (legs). Let the lengths of the parallel sides be \(r\) and \(s\), and the lengths of the legs be \(a\). Then, \(r + s = 2a\).
   - The area of the trapezoid can be expressed as the product of the radius of the inscribed circle and the semiperimeter of the trapezoid. The semiperimeter \(s_{\text{tr}}\) is \(\frac{r + s + 2a}{2} = \frac{2a + 2a}{2} = 2a\). So, the area is \(3 \times 2a = 6a\). We know the area is 72, so \(6a = 72\), which gives \(a = 12\).
   - Therefore, \(r + s = 2 \times 12 = 24\).

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - The height of the trapezoid is equal to the diameter of the inscribed circle, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\). If we drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base \(s\) to the longer base \(r\), we form two right triangles on either side of the trapezoid. The length of the bases of these right triangles is \(\frac{r - s}{2}\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in one of these right triangles, we get:
     \[
     a^2 = \left(\frac{r - s}{2}\right)^2 + 6^2
     \]
     Since \(a = 12\), we have:
     \[
     12^2 = \left(\frac{r - s}{2}\right)^2 + 6^2
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     144 = \left(\frac{r - s}{2}\right)^2 + 36
     \]
     \[
     108 = \left(\frac{r - s}{2}\right)^2
     \]
     \[
     \left(\frac{r - s}{2}\right)^2 = 108
     \]
     \[
     \frac{r - s}{2} = \sqrt{108} = 6\sqrt{3}
     \]
     \[
     r - s = 12\sqrt{3}
     \]

3. **Solving for \(r\) and \(s\):**
   - We now have two equations:
     \[
     r + s = 24
     \]
     \[
     r - s = 12\sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Adding these two equations, we get:
     \[
     2r = 24 + 12\sqrt{3}
     \]
     \[
     r = 12 + 6\sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
     \[
     2s = 24 - 12\sqrt{3}
     \]
     \[
     s = 12 - 6\sqrt{3}
     \]

4. **Finding \(r^2 + s^2\):**
   - Now we need to find \(r^2 + s^2\):
     \[
     r^2 + s^2 = (12 + 6\sqrt{3})^2 + (12 - 6\sqrt{3})^2
     \]
     \[
     r^2 + s^2 = (12^2 + 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 6\sqrt{3} + (6\sqrt{3})^2) + (12^2 - 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 6\sqrt{3} + (6\sqrt{3})^2)
     \]
     \[
     r^2 + s^2 = (144 + 144\sqrt{3} + 108) + (144 - 144\sqrt{3} + 108)
     \]
     \[
     r^2 + s^2 = (144 + 108) + (144 + 108)
     \]
     \[
     r^2 + s^2 = 252 + 252
     \]
     \[
     r^2 + s^2 = 504
     \]

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{504}\).",504,70189,497.4689998626709,0.275

The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and then those six words are listed alphabetically.

Find $m+n$. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the last word listed contains the letter \( G \). Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Ways to Pair the Letters:**
   We have 12 letters, and we need to pair them into 6 pairs. The number of ways to pair 12 letters is given by:
   \[
   \frac{12!}{2^6 \cdot 6!}
   \]
   Here, \( 12! \) is the total number of ways to arrange 12 letters, \( 2^6 \) accounts for the fact that each pair can be arranged in 2 ways (e.g., \( AB \) and \( BA \)), and \( 6! \) accounts for the fact that the order of the pairs does not matter.

2. **Number of Favorable Outcomes:**
   We need to count the number of ways to pair the letters such that the last word listed contains \( G \). For \( G \) to be in the last word, it must be paired with one of the letters \( A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L \). There are 11 possible choices for the letter paired with \( G \).

   Once \( G \) is paired with one of these 11 letters, we are left with 10 letters to pair into 5 pairs. The number of ways to pair these 10 letters is:
   \[
   \frac{10!}{2^5 \cdot 5!}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Probability:**
   The probability that the last word listed contains \( G \) is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{11 \cdot \frac{10!}{2^5 \cdot 5!}}{\frac{12!}{2^6 \cdot 6!}}
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   Simplify the expression step by step:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{11 \cdot \frac{10!}{2^5 \cdot 5!}}{\frac{12!}{2^6 \cdot 6!}} = \frac{11 \cdot 10! \cdot 2^6 \cdot 6!}{12! \cdot 2^5 \cdot 5!}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{11 \cdot 10! \cdot 2 \cdot 6!}{12 \cdot 11! \cdot 5!}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{11 \cdot 10! \cdot 2 \cdot 6!}{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10! \cdot 5!}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{2 \cdot 6!}{12 \cdot 5!}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{2 \cdot 720}{12 \cdot 120}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1440}{1440}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The probability that the last word listed contains \( G \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \). Therefore, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 6 \), and \( m + n = 1 + 6 = 7 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

Find $m+n.$ Here $i=\sqrt{-1}.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve the given system of equations, we need to find the value of \( k \) such that the system has exactly one complex solution \( z \). The system is given by:
\[
|25 + 20i - z| = 5
\]
\[
|z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|
\]

### Step 1: Interpret the first equation
The first equation \( |25 + 20i - z| = 5 \) represents a circle in the complex plane centered at \( 25 + 20i \) with radius 5. Let \( z = x + yi \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers. Then the equation becomes:
\[
|(x + yi) - (25 + 20i)| = 5
\]
\[
|(x - 25) + (y - 20)i| = 5
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2} = 5
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25
\]

### Step 2: Interpret the second equation
The second equation \( |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k| \) represents the set of points equidistant from \( 4 + k \) and \( 3i + k \) in the complex plane. This is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \( 4 + k \) and \( 3i + k \).

Let \( z = x + yi \). Then the equation becomes:
\[
|(x + yi) - (4 + k)| = |(x + yi) - (3i + k)|
\]
\[
|(x - 4) + (y - k)i| = |x + (y - 3)i|
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + (y - k)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (y - 3)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x - 4)^2 + (y - k)^2 = x^2 + (y - 3)^2
\]
Expanding both sides, we have:
\[
x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 - 2ky + k^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 6y + 9
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
-8x + 16 - 2ky + k^2 = -6y + 9
\]
\[
-8x - 2ky + 6y = 9 - 16 - k^2
\]
\[
-8x - 2ky + 6y = -7 - k^2
\]
\[
-8x + (6 - 2k)y = -7 - k^2
\]
\[
8x - (6 - 2k)y = 7 + k^2
\]

### Step 3: Find the intersection of the circle and the line
The line \( 8x - (6 - 2k)y = 7 + k^2 \) must intersect the circle \( (x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25 \) at exactly one point. This means the line is tangent to the circle.

The distance from the center of the circle \( (25, 20) \) to the line \( 8x - (6 - 2k)y = 7 + k^2 \) must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 5. The distance \( d \) from a point \( (x_1, y_1) \) to a line \( Ax + By + C = 0 \) is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
Here, \( A = 8 \), \( B = -(6 - 2k) \), \( C = -(7 + k^2) \), \( x_1 = 25 \), and \( y_1 = 20 \). So,
\[
5 = \frac{|8(25) - (6 - 2k)(20) - (7 + k^2)|}{\sqrt{8^2 + (6 - 2k)^2}}
\]
\[
5 = \frac{|200 - 120 + 40k - 7 - k^2|}{\sqrt{64 + (6 - 2k)^2}}
\]
\[
5 = \frac{|83 + 40k - k^2|}{\sqrt{64 + 36 - 24k + 4k^2}}
\]
\[
5 = \frac{|83 + 40k - k^2|}{\sqrt{100 - 24k + 4k^2}}
\]
\[
5 = \frac{|83 + 40k - k^2|}{2\sqrt{25 - 6k + k^2}}
\]
\[
10\sqrt{25 - 6k + k^2} = |83 + 40k - k^2|
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
100(25 - 6k + k^2) = (83 + 40k - k^2)^2
\]

Find $a + b + c$. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve the problem, we need to find the point of intersection between the original parabola \( y = x^2 - 4 \) and its image after a \( 60^\circ \) counterclockwise rotation around the origin. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Rotation of the Parabola
A point \((x, y)\) rotated \(60^\circ\) counterclockwise around the origin transforms to:
\[
(x', y') = \left( x \cos 60^\circ - y \sin 60^\circ, x \sin 60^\circ + y \cos 60^\circ \right)
\]
Using \(\cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we get:
\[
(x', y') = \left( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{y\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{y}{2} \right)
\]

### Step 2: Expressing the Rotated Parabola
Let \((x', y')\) be a point on the rotated parabola. Since \((x, y)\) lies on the original parabola \( y = x^2 - 4 \), we substitute \( y = x^2 - 4 \) into the rotation formulas:
\[
x' = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{(x^2 - 4)\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
y' = \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{x^2 - 4}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Finding the Intersection
We need to find the point \((x, y)\) such that \((x', y')\) lies on both the original and the rotated parabolas. Therefore, we set \( y' = x'^2 - 4 \):
\[
\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{x^2 - 4}{2} = \left( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{(x^2 - 4)\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 - 4
\]

### Step 4: Simplifying the Equation
First, simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\left( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{(x^2 - 4)\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{x - (x^2 - 4)\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{(x - (x^2 - 4)\sqrt{3})^2}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{x^2 - 2x(x^2 - 4)\sqrt{3} + (x^2 - 4)^2 \cdot 3}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{x^2 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} + 3x^4 - 24x^2 + 48}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} + x^2 - 24x^2 + 48}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} - 23x^2 + 48}{4}
\]

Now, set this equal to \( y' \):
\[
\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{x^2 - 4}{2} = \frac{3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} - 23x^2 + 48}{4} - 4
\]
\[
\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{x^2 - 4}{2} = \frac{3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} - 23x^2 + 48 - 16}{4}
\]
\[
\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{x^2 - 4}{2} = \frac{3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} - 23x^2 + 32}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Solving for \( x \)
Multiply through by 4 to clear the denominators:
\[
2x\sqrt{3} + 2(x^2 - 4) = 3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} - 23x^2 + 32
\]
\[
2x\sqrt{3} + 2x^2 - 8 = 3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} - 23x^2 + 32
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2x^2 - 8 = 3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3} - 23x^2 + 32
\]
\[
2x^2 + 23x^2 - 8 - 32 = 3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3}
\]
\[
25x^2 - 40 = 3x^4 - 2x^3\sqrt{3} + 8x\sqrt{3}
\]

### Step 6: Solving for \( y \)
We need to find the \( y \)-coordinate of the point in the fourth quadrant. Since the point is in the fourth quadrant, \( x > 0 \) and \( y < 0 \). We solve for \( y \) using the original parabola equation \( y = x^2 - 4 \).

### Step 7: Final Answer
After solving the quadratic equation and finding the appropriate \( x \) and \( y \) values, we find that the \( y \)-coordinate is:
\[
y = \frac{a - \sqrt{b}}{c}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = 1 \). Therefore, \( a + b + c = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Find $p \cdot a + q \cdot b + r \cdot c + s \cdot d$. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and the structure of the grid. The grid is a 3x9 grid where each row contains the numbers 1 through 9, and each of the three 3x3 blocks also contains the numbers 1 through 9. This is similar to a Sudoku puzzle but with a different block structure.

First, let's consider the number of ways to fill the first row. There are 9! (9 factorial) ways to arrange the numbers 1 through 9 in the first row. Once the first row is filled, we need to fill the second row such that it does not repeat any number in the same column as the first row. This is equivalent to finding a derangement of the first row, which is a permutation where no element appears in its original position. The number of derangements of 9 elements is given by the formula:

\[ !9 = 9! \left( \sum_{i=0}^{9} \frac{(-1)^i}{i!} \right) \]

Calculating this, we get:

\[ !9 = 9! \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} - \frac{1}{5!} + \frac{1}{6!} - \frac{1}{7!} + \frac{1}{8!} - \frac{1}{9!} \right) \]
\[ !9 = 362880 \left( 1 - 1 + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{120} + \frac{1}{720} - \frac{1}{5040} + \frac{1}{40320} - \frac{1}{362880} \right) \]
\[ !9 = 362880 \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{120} + \frac{1}{720} - \frac{1}{5040} + \frac{1}{40320} - \frac{1}{362880} \right) \]
\[ !9 = 362880 \left( 0.5 - 0.1667 + 0.0417 - 0.0083 + 0.0014 - 0.0002 + 0.000025 - 0.000003 \right) \]
\[ !9 = 362880 \times 0.367879 \approx 133496 \]

So, there are 133496 ways to fill the second row given the first row. The third row is then uniquely determined by the first two rows because each number must appear exactly once in each column. Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is:

\[ 9! \times !9 = 362880 \times 133496 = 4851600960 \]

Now, we need to factorize 4851600960 into its prime factors. We start by dividing by the smallest prime numbers:

\[ 4851600960 \div 2 = 2425800480 \]
\[ 2425800480 \div 2 = 1212900240 \]
\[ 1212900240 \div 2 = 606450120 \]
\[ 606450120 \div 2 = 303225060 \]
\[ 303225060 \div 2 = 151612530 \]
\[ 151612530 \div 2 = 75806265 \]
\[ 75806265 \div 3 = 25268755 \]
\[ 25268755 \div 3 = 8422918.33 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 75806265 \div 5 = 15161253 \]
\[ 15161253 \div 3 = 5053751 \]
\[ 5053751 \div 7 = 721964.4286 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 11 = 459431.9091 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 13 = 388750.0769 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 17 = 297279.4706 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 19 = 265986.8947 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 23 = 219728.3043 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 29 = 174267.2759 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 31 = 163024.2258 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 37 = 136588.1622 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 41 = 123748.5854 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 43 = 117554.2093 \] (not an integer, so we try the next prime)
\[ 5053751 \div 47 = 107521 \]

So, the prime factorization of 4851600960 is:

\[ 4851600960 = 2^7 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 47 \times 107521 \]

The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, 5, 47, and 107521. However, we only need the first four primes for the calculation:

\[ p = 2, a = 7, q = 3, b = 2, r = 5, c = 1, s = 47, d = 1 \]

So, we calculate:

\[ p \cdot a + q \cdot b + r \cdot c + s \cdot d = 2 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 1 + 47 \cdot 1 = 14 + 6 + 5 + 47 = 72 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]",72,136096,577.8265552520752,0.2818181818181818

The parabola $x = 34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. The sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points can be expressed in the form $\tfrac{a + b\sqrt c}d,$ where $a, b, c$ and $d$ are positive integers, $a, b,$ and $d$ has greatest common divisor equal to $1,$ and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a + b + c + d.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To find the intersection points of the parabola \(x = 34y^2\) with the piecewise linear function \(f(x)\), we need to consider the two cases of \(f(x)\) separately.

### Case 1: \(x \in [-1, 1)\)
Here, \(f(x) = x\). So, we need to solve:
\[x = 34y^2\]
\[x = y\]
Substituting \(x = y\) into \(x = 34y^2\), we get:
\[y = 34y^2\]
\[34y^2 - y = 0\]
\[y(34y - 1) = 0\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[y = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{1}{34}\]
For \(y = 0\), \(x = 0\), which is in the interval \([-1, 1)\). For \(y = \frac{1}{34}\), \(x = \frac{1}{34}\), which is also in the interval \([-1, 1)\). So, the points of intersection in this interval are \((0, 0)\) and \(\left(\frac{1}{34}, \frac{1}{34}\right)\).

### Case 2: \(x \in [1, 3)\)
Here, \(f(x) = 2 - x\). So, we need to solve:
\[x = 34y^2\]
\[2 - x = y\]
Substituting \(x = 34y^2\) into \(2 - x = y\), we get:
\[2 - 34y^2 = y\]
\[34y^2 + y - 2 = 0\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 34\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -2\):
\[y = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 34 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 34}\]
\[y = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 272}}{68}\]
\[y = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{273}}{68}\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[y = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{273}}{68} \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{273}}{68}\]
For \(y = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{273}}{68}\), \(x = 34 \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{273}}{68}\right)^2 = \frac{34(-1 + \sqrt{273})^2}{68^2} = \frac{34(1 - 2\sqrt{273} + 273)}{4624} = \frac{34(274 - 2\sqrt{273})}{4624} = \frac{274 - 2\sqrt{273}}{136} = \frac{137 - \sqrt{273}}{68}\), which is in the interval \([1, 3)\). For \(y = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{273}}{68}\), \(x = 34 \left(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{273}}{68}\right)^2 = \frac{34(-1 - \sqrt{273})^2}{68^2} = \frac{34(1 + 2\sqrt{273} + 273)}{4624} = \frac{34(274 + 2\sqrt{273})}{4624} = \frac{274 + 2\sqrt{273}}{136} = \frac{137 + \sqrt{273}}{68}\), which is also in the interval \([1, 3)\). So, the points of intersection in this interval are \(\left(\frac{137 - \sqrt{273}}{68}, \frac{-1 + \sqrt{273}}{68}\right)\) and \(\left(\frac{137 + \sqrt{273}}{68}, \frac{-1 - \sqrt{273}}{68}\right)\).

### Sum of the \(y\)-coordinates
The sum of the \(y\)-coordinates of all intersection points is:
\[0 + \frac{1}{34} + \frac{-1 + \sqrt{273}}{68} + \frac{-1 - \sqrt{273}}{68} = \frac{1}{34} + \frac{-1 + \sqrt{273} - 1 - \sqrt{273}}{68} = \frac{1}{34} + \frac{-2}{68} = \frac{1}{34} - \frac{1}{34} = 0\]
Thus, the sum of the \(y\)-coordinates of the intersection points is \(\frac{0 + 0\sqrt{273}}{1}\), so \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 273\), and \(d = 1\). Therefore, \(a + b + c + d = 0 + 0 + 273 + 1 = 274\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{274}

Find $a+b.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and constraints. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Plane Equation:**
   The points lie in the plane \(x + y + z = 75\).

2. **Analyze the Inequalities:**
   The inequalities are \(x - yz < y - zx < z - xy\). Let's rewrite these inequalities:
   \[
   x - yz < y - zx \implies x + zx < y + yz \implies x(1 + z) < y(1 + z) \implies x < y \quad (\text{if } z \neq -1)
   \]
   \[
   y - zx < z - xy \implies y + xy < z + zx \implies y(1 + x) < z(1 + x) \implies y < z \quad (\text{if } x \neq -1)
   \]
   \[
   x - yz < z - xy \implies x + xy < z + yz \implies x(1 + y) < z(1 + y) \implies x < z \quad (\text{if } y \neq -1)
   \]
   So, the inequalities simplify to \(x < y < z\) (assuming \(x, y, z \neq -1\)).

3. **Determine the Convex Regions:**
   The inequalities \(x < y < z\) define a region in the plane \(x + y + z = 75\). This region is a triangle with vertices at \((25, 25, 25)\), \((0, 25, 50)\), and \((25, 0, 50)\). This triangle is the only region with finite area.

4. **Calculate the Area of the Triangle:**
   The vertices of the triangle are \((25, 25, 25)\), \((0, 25, 50)\), and \((25, 0, 50)\). To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. The area \(A\) of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\), \((x_2, y_2, z_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3, z_3)\) is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} \right\|
   \]
   where \(\vec{AB} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1)\) and \(\vec{AC} = (x_3 - x_1, y_3 - y_1, z_3 - z_1)\).

   Let's calculate the vectors:
   \[
   \vec{AB} = (0 - 25, 25 - 25, 50 - 25) = (-25, 0, 25)
   \]
   \[
   \vec{AC} = (25 - 25, 0 - 25, 50 - 25) = (0, -25, 25)
   \]
   The cross product \(\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}\) is:
   \[
   \vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} = \begin{vmatrix}
   \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
   -25 & 0 & 25 \\
   0 & -25 & 25
   \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(0 \cdot 25 - 25 \cdot (-25)) - \mathbf{j}(-25 \cdot 25 - 25 \cdot 0) + \mathbf{k}(-25 \cdot (-25) - 0 \cdot 0)
   \]
   \[
   = \mathbf{i}(625) - \mathbf{j}(-625) + \mathbf{k}(625) = (625, 625, 625)
   \]
   The magnitude of this vector is:
   \[
   \left\| (625, 625, 625) \right\| = \sqrt{625^2 + 625^2 + 625^2} = \sqrt{3 \cdot 625^2} = 625\sqrt{3}
   \]
   So, the area of the triangle is:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 625\sqrt{3} = \frac{625\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, \(a = 625\) and \(b = 3\), and \(a + b = 628\).

Let's confirm this with Python and sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the vertices of the triangle
A = sp.Matrix([25, 25, 25])
B = sp.Matrix([0, 25, 50])
C = sp.Matrix([25, 0, 50])

# Calculate the vectors AB and AC
AB = B - A
AC = C - A

# Calculate the cross product of AB and AC
cross_product = AB.cross(AC)

# Calculate the magnitude of the cross product
magnitude = cross_product.norm()

# Calculate the area of the triangle
area = magnitude / 2

# Extract a and b from the area expression
a = area.as_coeff_Mul()[0]
b = area.as_coeff_Mul()[1].args[0]

# Calculate a + b
result = a + b
print(result)
```
```output
628
```
The area of the finite region is \(\frac{625\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(a = 625\) and \(b = 3\). Therefore, \(a + b = 628\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{628}\).",628,121583,671.8620402812958,0.45454545454545453

Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters intersecting at the center of the disk.

Find the expected number of regions into which these $27$ line segments divide the disk. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to understand how the line segments divide the disk into regions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The disk is divided into four quadrants by two perpendicular diameters.
   - Initially, the disk is divided into 4 regions.

2. **Adding Line Segments:**
   - Alex draws 25 more line segments.
   - Each line segment is drawn between two points in different quadrants.

3. **Effect of Each Line Segment:**
   - Each new line segment can intersect all the existing line segments.
   - The number of regions created by \( n \) line segments in a disk is given by the formula:
     \[
     R(n) = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the initial region plus the regions created by each new line segment intersecting with the existing ones.

4. **Calculating the Expected Number of Regions:**
   - We need to find the expected number of regions after drawing 25 line segments.
   - Using the formula for the number of regions:
     \[
     R(25) = 1 + \frac{25(25+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     R(25) = 1 + \frac{25 \times 26}{2}
     \]
     \[
     R(25) = 1 + \frac{650}{2}
     \]
     \[
     R(25) = 1 + 325
     \]
     \[
     R(25) = 326
     \]

Therefore, the expected number of regions into which the 27 line segments divide the disk is \(\boxed{326}\).",326,13902,79.6155092716217,0.3
