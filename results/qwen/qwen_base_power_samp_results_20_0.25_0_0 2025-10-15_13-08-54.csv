Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$,70,"Can you solve the following math problem? Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To solve this problem, we need to find all integer bases \( b > 9 \) for which \( 17_b \) is a divisor of \( 97_b \). Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Convert the numbers from base \( b \) to base 10:**
   - \( 17_b \) in base 10 is \( 1 \cdot b + 7 = b + 7 \).
   - \( 97_b \) in base 10 is \( 9 \cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7 \).

2. **Set up the divisibility condition:**
   - We need \( 9b + 7 \) to be divisible by \( b + 7 \). This means \( 9b + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 7} \).

3. **Simplify the congruence:**
   - We can rewrite \( 9b + 7 \) as \( 9(b + 7) - 56 \). So, \( 9(b + 7) - 56 \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 7} \).
   - This simplifies to \( -56 \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 7} \), or \( 56 \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 7} \).
   - This means \( b + 7 \) must be a divisor of 56.

4. **Find the divisors of 56:**
   - The divisors of 56 are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 7, \pm 8, \pm 14, \pm 28, \pm 56 \).
   - Since \( b > 9 \), we only consider the positive divisors greater than 16 (because \( b + 7 > 16 \)).

5. **List the valid bases:**
   - The valid bases are \( b + 7 = 28 \) and \( b + 7 = 56 \), which gives \( b = 21 \) and \( b = 49 \).

6. **Sum the valid bases:**
   - The sum of the valid bases is \( 21 + 49 = 70 \).

Let's implement this in Python to verify our solution:

```python
# Define the divisors of 56
divisors_of_56 = [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56]

# Find the valid bases
valid_bases = [d - 7 for d in divisors_of_56 if d - 7 > 9]

# Sum the valid bases
sum_of_valid_bases = sum(valid_bases)
print(sum_of_valid_bases)
```
```output
70
```
The sum of all integer bases \( b > 9 \) for which \( 17_b \) is a divisor of \( 97_b \) is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,9782,125.77791833877563,0.425,"[12, 5]"
