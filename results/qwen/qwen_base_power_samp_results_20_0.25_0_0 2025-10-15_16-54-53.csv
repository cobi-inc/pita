1. **Substitute specific values for \( x \) and \( y \) to find a pattern or simplify the equation.**

   Let's start by substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
   \[
   f(0) + f(0) = f(0 + 0) - 0 \cdot 0 - 1
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2f(0) = f(0) - 1
   \]
   Solving for \( f(0) \):
   \[
   2f(0) - f(0) = -1 \implies f(0) = -1
   \]

2. **Use the value of \( f(0) \) to find a general form for \( f(x) \).**

   Next, let's substitute \( y = 1 \):
   \[
   f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x \cdot 1 - 1
   \]
   Given \( f(1) = 1 \), this becomes:
   \[
   f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \implies f(x) + 2 = f(x + 1) - x
   \]
   Rearranging terms:
   \[
   f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2
   \]

3. **Determine the form of \( f(x) \) using the recurrence relation.**

   We have the recurrence relation:
   \[
   f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2
   \]
   To find \( f(x) \), we can use the initial condition \( f(1) = 1 \) and iterate:
   \[
   f(2) = f(1) + 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
   \]
   \[
   f(3) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8
   \]
   \[
   f(4) = f(3) + 3 + 2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13
   \]
   Observing the pattern, we hypothesize that \( f(x) = \frac{x(x + 1)}{2} + 1 \).

4. **Verify the hypothesis by induction.**

   **Base case:** For \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   f(1) = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} + 1 = \frac{2}{2} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 1
   \]
   The base case holds.

   **Inductive step:** Assume \( f(k) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). We need to show that \( f(k + 1) = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} + 1 \):
   \[
   f(k + 1) = f(k) + k + 2
   \]
   Using the inductive hypothesis:
   \[
   f(k + 1) = \left( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + 1 \right) + k + 2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   f(k + 1) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + k + 3
   \]
   \[
   f(k + 1) = \frac{k^2 + k + 2k + 6}{2}
   \]
   \[
   f(k + 1) = \frac{k^2 + 3k + 6}{2}
   \]
   \[
   f(k + 1) = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} + 1
   \]
   The inductive step holds.

5. **Find the integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).**

   We need to solve:
   \[
   \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1 = n
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1 = n
   \]
   \[
   \frac{n^2 + n}{2} + 1 = n
   \]
   \[
   n^2 + n + 2 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n^2 - n + 2 = 0
   \]
   Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-7}}{2}
   \]
   Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions. Therefore, there are no integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{No such integers}}
\]",there are no integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \),2718,15.462086200714111," Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Functional Equation:**
   The functional equation given is \( f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \).

2. **Substitute Specific Values:**
   Let's start by substituting \( y = 0 \) into the functional equation:
   \[
   f(x) + f(0) = f(x + 0) - x \cdot 0 - 1 \implies f(x) + f(0) = f(x) - 1 \implies f(0) = -1.
   \]

3. **Use the Given Value \( f(1) = 1 \):**
   Now we have \( f(0) = -1 \) and \( f(1) = 1 \). Let's substitute \( y = 1 \) into the functional equation:
   \[
   f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x \cdot 1 - 1 \implies f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \implies f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2.
   \]
   This gives us a way to find \( f(n) \) for any integer \( n \) by using the recurrence relation \( f(n + 1) = f(n) + n + 2 \).

4. **Find the General Form of \( f(n) \):**
   We know \( f(1) = 1 \). Using the recurrence relation, we can find \( f(2) \), \( f(3) \), and so on:
   \[
   f(2) = f(1) + 1 + 2 = 1 + 3 = 4,
   \]
   \[
   f(3) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 4 = 8,
   \]
   \[
   f(4) = f(3) + 3 + 2 = 8 + 5 = 13,
   \]
   and so on. We can generalize this pattern:
   \[
   f(n) = f(n-1) + (n-1) + 2.
   \]
   Let's express this in a closed form. We can write:
   \[
   f(n) = f(0) + \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k + 2) = -1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} k + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2.
   \]
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) and the sum of 2 \( n \) times is \( 2n \):
   \[
   f(n) = -1 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 2n = \frac{n(n+1) + 4n - 2}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 5n - 2}{2}.
   \]

5. **Find All Integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \):**
   We need to solve \( \frac{n^2 + 5n - 2}{2} = n \):
   \[
   n^2 + 5n - 2 = 2n \implies n^2 + 3n - 2 = 0.
   \]
   Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \):
   \[
   n = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 8}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{17}}{2}.
   \]
   Since we are looking for integers, we need to check if \( \frac{-3 + \sqrt{17}}{2} \) or \( \frac{-3 - \sqrt{17}}{2} \) are integers. We see that neither of them are integers.

Thus, there are no integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

     \]

3. **Find \( f(3) \):**
   - Let \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \):
     \[

5. **Generalize the pattern:**
   - From the above calculations, we observe that \( f(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \). We will prove this by induction.

   - For \( n = 1 \):
     \[
     f(1) = \frac{1(1+1)}{2} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 1

     This matches the given condition \( f(1) = 1 \).

7. **Inductive step:**
   - Assume \( f(k) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} - 1 \) holds for some integer \( k \).
   - We need to show that \( f(k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} - 1 \).

   - Using the functional equation with \( x = k \) and \( y = 1 \):

     Substituting \( f(k) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} - 1 \) and \( f(1) = 1 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} - 1 \right) + 1 = f(k + 1) - k - 1
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = f(k + 1) - k - 1
     \]
     \[
     f(k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k + 1
     \]
     \[
     f(k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1) + 2k + 2}{2}
     \]
     \[
     f(k + 1) = \frac{k^2 + k + 2k + 2}{2}
     \]
     \[
     f(k + 1) = \frac{k^2 + 3k + 2}{2}
     \]
     \[
     f(k + 1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} - 1

   - Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \) holds for all integers \( n \).

To solve the functional equation \( f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \) with the condition \( f(1) = 1 \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Substitute specific values for \( x \) and \( y \) to find a pattern or simplify the equation.**

   Let's start by substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
   \[
   f(0) + f(0) = f(0 + 0) - 0 \cdot 0 - 1
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[

   \]
   Solving for \( f(0) \):
   \[
   2f(0) - f(0) = -1 \implies f(0) = -1
   \]

2. **Next, substitute \( y = 1 \) into the original equation:**
   \[
   f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x \cdot 1 - 1
   \]
   Given \( f(1) = 1 \), this becomes:
   \[

   Simplifying further:
   \[
   f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \implies f(x) + 2 = f(x + 1) - x

   Rearranging terms:
   \[
   f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2

3. **Use the recurrence relation to find a general form for \( f(x) \):**
   We have:
   \[
   f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2

   Let's compute a few values to identify a pattern:
   \[
   f(2) = f(1) + 1 + 2 = 1 + 3 = 4

   \[

   Since \( f(1) = 1 \), we have:

   Set \( f(n) = n \):
