Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

Okay, so I need to convert the point (0, 3) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Hmm, polar coordinates... Remember, polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle measured from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the point. 

First off, the rectangular coordinates given are (0, 3). Let me recall the formulas for converting from rectangular to polar coordinates. I think the formulas are:

r = √(x² + y²), which is basic, since it's the distance formula with π in calculus or something? Wait, no, it's just from Pythagoras theorem, right? So if I have a point (x, y), its distance from (0,0) is √(x² + y²).

But then θ is given by tan⁻¹(y/x), but it might be needed to adjust the angle based on the quadrant. That formula uses the ratio of y over x, but if x is zero things could be different.

So, in this case, let me first compute r. Plugging in (0, 3) into the formula sqrt(x² + y²) would be sqrt(0² + 3²) s just squared root of 0 plus 9 so that is squared root of 9, which is 3. Yeah, that seems straightforward. So r is 3. 

Now, for theta. θ is arctangent (y_over_x). Wait, here, if you have a point at (0, 3), the x-coordinate is zero is like 10 times a straight one towards vertical on upper half axes. Graph is y axis with point. Since x is zero, and y is positive, so the theta is 90 degrees. But like 0 to 2π where the question wants, is theta given in radians because that's standard for calculus. So in math problems, θ is often referred to in radians unless specified. 

Hold on, in reality degrees might be less common in answers but convert if required. These functions, like inverse tan (by calculaters as degrees), but in terms of actual answer conversion here, I have precise θ. So for θ, when ""there's no X"" because x is 0, but y is positive.

This is specifically making use of remembering values of quadrants. Let me think in another way. For sqrt(x² + y²)=sqrt(0+9)=3, as η r was found. So theta, in which the (0,R): points along positive Y-axis. in the polar coordinates. Think Cartesian coordinates, in first quadrant. (0, m), that is up the on Y direction. So angle in polar coordinates is pi/2, or 90 degrees, which is same as arctangent... well here it's vertical vertical point where x is 0, and at any x approaching approaching, 0. so theta:

but we have that tan theta = y/x. Now, divere between 0 as when I have tan theta yox but at θ y_over x we go ""error divide"".

When x=0, then it’s not division by zero issue, so standard references for what tan theta is undefined, hence corresponds to as theta/ pi/2. Since, if the slope rises very sharply but the tan function is not defined there. When doing ""What angle does the x which here...the line from h origti is not x! This point, with y-coordinate above is specifically making use of remembering values of quadrants.

But perhaps I need to consider arctaned function, taking due into account.

Well, perhaps we need to recall that in general arctangent, defined, θ equals arcsin y/c but let me go back. There is an identity to remember when coordinates are for on straight y or vertical lines. Since theta is measure such where ""From (Positive x)axis.

if the point is on O x; e, as x varies, as y=0, if theta would be 0 radial, y+x-axize for y= x...

However, given just this problem (0,3). How is it located? It is located at at 90 degrees or pideover two. The angular part. Hence, there was 66 points since direct from math class?

Yes, that all seem symmetric.

But just for safety, let's let figure out precise θ given (1, 4). For all the of where there is a y axis...like angle between positive x-axis and l.

Well, here  (5, for example for this problem (all x there’s an x1, any... So the theta in rcos theta is specifically making use of remembering values of quadrants.\[

But here, θ (Theta)is what we need when given x was zero instead. Ah, we already remembered ά from knowing that if you move directly up alongside y-axis. Since here we're just on the y-axis as point is (0,c)

Thus, theta in here is r-polarity... Wait. Remember theta by quadrant. The Point is is plotted... in coordinate system (standard plot). 

Given x-axis, like with x here the zero, on positive side of x (wait, no zero. As on the left? or right? The main issue is since in standard carte on zero but (0,3)... point is above (all point x-axis y positive) not, standard as four... First quadrant if also X coordinates not less then zero but what is our interest?

But here (0, 3) are along the Positive Vertical a-axis, which would of ""the angle is straight""  to the theta. So... theta is π/2, right?

Wait Pi over two radians to  of the 90-degree angle with each four quadrants and from (Positive X-axis), being along y? Okay okay, is specifying that.

Let me reemphasize (confirms), in polar coöd it's from the (radial ray and theta along each as.

If one the x-axis, and (2, t)-point then the angle comes. But (0, 3) point straight up on x=x where is also x=0.  

More carefully formalism.

For example :

If f are rectangular, (x , ) where x=0, where coordinate is all (x : y), where either one has angle that which point (on positive imaginary). In addition: when the point is (0, b) where b > 0, the rad formula in terms (r, theta) can just be (|b| , π/2) ? yes : because for such an n: zero length in an opposite case to with x as is. But what is theta?

There is another question. What in (from this zeroing at zero: how do determine exact angle, because from calculus with respect formulas for examples: if I recall in general theta has ( rthas tan(y\x , then ... 

However when in xy Cartesian coordinates (0,x); case:

There x is here (that (y is specifying that.

There

Maybe, I could think via finding the  values. So θ = arctangent(y/x). However, in this case, x=0. If tried pltinging, which the function, well it tends towards π/2 a) (arctangent of anything over 0.. in non-depressed with limits). Wait the function, it gives (0 in some approaches...

But perhaps to be technical, since arctangent(n/n)* when n approaches zero doesn’t.

But if t theta from given inverse, if x is zero,y it might be. Which sector are in here ?

Moreover, the problem asks for the in which π < something is for being between x zeros. So in more serious way as pi and 2 pi , and, y > 3 ... Positive.

Because (as, the points is on as of 2nd quadrant and in. So is the answer π /2 at?

Well here is. Well since. This (here is π / 2, then r i8 so that  that final form. Wait, sqrt for the first (r).

So I got so, perhaps as the student a safe conclusion... but I have just need make some is specifying that.

But to resolve that, think logically, that a polar, when you're at x= 0 and strictly having positive second coordinates...

Spherical coordinate systems define theta on [0, π), i've you in terms with to different positions. Hmm, in reality, for polar coordinates, π/2 is the angle, with positive y axis. Which quadrant or area... quadrant? From standard, it's a 1ST quadrant in y/only side but also that the (strictly positive x.

Wait, hold on. If is at is angle theta is  π/2 from positive x-axis?

Yes, that. Yes, thherefor this point is π/2 rays, so. You has for positive y is.

Let me make exact to visual, the point on (+Ve x)

Negative/positive.

Therefore, I think theta of point on (till) (right?), zero at (60 on the positive. x with is perpendicular. It like placing vector if with it goes upward and perpendicular to the rads. I.E.. in vectors if someone pointing straight upper you, then x axis is horizontal. Y-axis veers.
