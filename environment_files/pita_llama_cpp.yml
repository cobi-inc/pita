  - pip:
      # Install llama-cpp-python 
      - llama-cpp-python
      # Test dependencies
      - pytest

# NOTE: This environment file installs llama-cpp-python and pytest only.
# After creating the environment, install pita itself from your local checkout:
#   conda activate pita_llama_cpp
#   cd /path/to/pita
#   pip install -e .
#
# The Quick Installation instructions in the README show running
#   pip install -e .
# before installing llama-cpp-python. Here, llama-cpp-python is installed
# as part of the environment creation and pita is installed afterwards.
# This difference in order is intentional and should be functionally
# equivalent for normal use.
